The Matrix class 

Let’s now define a Matrix Class to represent 4x4 matrices. Our matrices will always
be of dimension 4x4.

Several behaviors of the Matrix Class are to be deducted from the code
and of the outputs that follows these explanations. The rest is up to you.



The Class’ constructor is waiting for an array. The following keys are required:

’preset’: the matrix type to, mandatory. The value must be one of the Class
constants previoulsy defined.

’scale’: the scale factor, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth SCALE.

’angle’: the rotation angle in radians, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth RX, RY
or RZ.

’vtc’: translation vector, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth TRANSLATION.

’fov’: projection field of view in degrees mandatory when ’preset’
is worth PROJECTION.

’ratio’: projected image ratio, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.

’near’: projection’s near clipping plane mandatory when ’preset’
is worth PROJECTION.

’far’: projection’s far clipping plane mandatory when ’preset’
is worth PROJECTION.

The class provides the following methods :

Matrix mult( Matrix $rhs ) : returns the multiplication of both matrices.

Vertex transformVertex( Vertex $vtx ) : returns a new vertex resulting from
the transformation of the vertex by the matrix.
