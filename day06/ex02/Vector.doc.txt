The Vector Class 


The Vector Class will allow us to introduce a convention. To orient
themselves in 3D, one has the choice between a mark called "Left hand" or called
"Right hand". Search Google for the definition and consider that from now on,
 we will work in a "Right hand" mark.

An instance can be contructed by a simple vertex as destination and another 
optionale as origine"

$vertex = new Vertex( array( 'x' => 15, 'y'=>6, 'z'=> 2) );
new Vector(array("dest" => vertex);
Or 
$origin = new Vertex( array( 'x' => 0, 'y'=>0, 'z'=> 0) );
$vertex = new Vertex( array( 'x' => 15, 'y'=>6, 'z'=> 2) );
new Vector(array("dest" => vertex, "orig" => $origin);

The class provides the following methods :

float magnitude() : returns the vector’s length (or "norm").

Vector normalize() : returns a normalized version of the vector. If the vector 
is already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Vector add( Vector $rhs ) : returns the sum vector of both vectors.

Vector sub( Vector $rhs ) : returns the difference vector of both vectors.

Vector opposite() : returns the opposite vector.

Vector scalarProduct( $k ) : returns the multiplication of the vector with a
scalar.
float dotProduct( Vector $rhs ) : returns the scalar multiplication of
both vectors.

float cos( Vector $rhs ) : returns the angle’sAppendix cosine between
both vectors.

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs ) : returns the cross multiplication of both
vectors (right-hand mark!).
